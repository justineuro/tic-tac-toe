## t3C and t3

`t3C` and `t3` are [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script (see [Wikipedia:Bash\_(Unix_shell)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) for more info) implementations of the usual [Tic-Tac-Toe (or Noughts-and-Crosses)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-Tac-Toe) [paper-and-pencil game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper-and-pencil\_game).  

`t3C` is for colored x-terminals while `t3` is for black-and-white x-terminals.  Both bash scripts are two-player implementations of tic-tac-toe.

To play: at the command line, within the directory containing the script issue the command:
```bash
bash t3C
```
(or simply `t3C` if the this script is on your path of executables, i.e., if `echo $PATH` shows a list of directories that includes the directory containing the bash script `t3C`.  To make sure, you can copy these two bash scripts to your `$HOME/.local/bin directory` then add the `.local/bin` directory to your `$PATH`).

A a screenshot (partly edited) is given below.
